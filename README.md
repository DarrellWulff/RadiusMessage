## What is Radius Message?


   Radius Message is an experimental social media app that focuses on users moving around outside in order to find and enter the "radius" of a message circle. Once inside the circle the user can see what someone else has posted in the form of a message story board that is reminiscent of other "story" functionalities. 


## Use Example

### First we might be walking around a trail.

### Using the big plus button we can enter into the post creation menu.

### After pressing "ok" we can plot down our new post exactly where we are standing!

### You can only tap and view the message when you physically in the message circle, so we tap to see what is inside of our new post.
